# 1: Reddit crawler and Telegram bot

## How to run this part:

Go to this directory `desafios\crawlers\` and type the following command:

```python
python crawler.py 'subreddit1;subreddit2'
```
Example:
```python
python bot.py 'cats;dogs'
```
### How to run the chatbot:

First of all, you need to get a new token through [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather).<br />
With your code ready, past it in the command below:

```python
python bot.py 'token'
```
Example (the token below is not a real token):
```python
python bot.py '821001893:AJ2HD3K2OWAC-C3HL3DsHNEhJMlkaC3tFbWI'
```
Remember that you need to maintain the command running while you are talking to the bot.

## Guideline

Divide the subreddits with a semicolon, inside a single quotation mark
